# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**GameMaster's Companion (GMC)** is a privacy-focused, self-hosted digital assistant for tabletop RPG Game Masters and players. It provides AI-enhanced content management, real-time collaboration, and intelligent automation for D&D 5e and similar RPG systems.

### Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, designed for multi-device collaboration
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) with PostgreSQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch  
- **AI/ML**: Local LLM deployment (vllm) and audio processing (diart)
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes-native deployment optimized for self-hosting

### Core Features
- Character Management with relationship tracking
- World Building with hierarchical location system
- AI-powered content generation and session summarization
- Real-time audio processing and keyword detection
- Multi-device collaboration with role-based access
- Intelligent fuzzy search for fantasy terminology

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop (running)
- Kind v0.20+
- kubectl v1.28+
- Helm v3.12+

### Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Make scripts executable (Linux/Mac)
chmod +x infrastructure/scripts/*.sh

# Create and configure Kind cluster with all services
./infrastructure/scripts/setup-kind-cluster.sh
```

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Check status of all services
./infrastructure/scripts/dev-workflow.sh status

# View service logs
./infrastructure/scripts/dev-workflow.sh logs <service>

# Access services locally
./infrastructure/scripts/dev-workflow.sh port-forward all
```

### Service Endpoints
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Database**: localhost:5432 (postgres/changeme)

## Component-Specific Guidance

For detailed guidance on working with specific components:

- **Infrastructure**: See [infrastructure/CLAUDE.md](infrastructure/CLAUDE.md) for Kubernetes, Helm, and deployment guidance
- **Backend**: See [backend/CLAUDE.md](backend/CLAUDE.md) for FastAPI, database, and AI service development
- **Frontend**: See [frontend/CLAUDE.md](frontend/CLAUDE.md) for React, UI components, and real-time features

## Current Development Status

- âœ… Complete Kubernetes infrastructure with Kind development environment
- âœ… Helm charts for all services with comprehensive configuration
- âœ… Development workflow automation scripts
- ðŸš§ Core API implementation (planned)
- ðŸš§ Frontend development (planned)
- ðŸ“‹ AI integration implementation (planned)
